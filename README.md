## About me

In 2013 i take my **Bachelor** degree in **Systems Analysis** but never work in I.T area before. In 2021 after a huge change in my personal life, i start search a new area to study and try a new profission. *Cloud Computing* call my attention and since then i'm start do a loot of search and take classes about it. I decide start my journey in Microsoft Cloud called "Azure" and Azure Fudamentals test is the first certification in my trail (wish me luck üçÄ). Here i'll put all my progression, and use this document to revise the content of certification.
